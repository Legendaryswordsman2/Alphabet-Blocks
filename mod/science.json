	/* supported fields for AddScience / AddOrOverrideScience entries
		requireScienceBiome -> if set, this will autocomplete the science if the colony has a banner in said sciencebiome, bypassing other requirements
		icon -> icon path relative to this json file
		colonistCount -> threshold required to be able to complete
		colonyPointRequirement -> quantity required that'll be consumed on complete
		itemRequirements -> array of amount/type pairs of items that'll be consumed when completing the science
		dependencies -> array of other science keys which are required to be completed before this one can be completed
		unlocksRecipes -> array of recipe keys which will be unlocked when this research is completed. Recipes may require multiple researches to show up.
		unlocksRecipeGroups -> same as unlocksRecipes, but counts *all* recipes associated with the NPCTypes put in this array
		unlocksClientHints -> array of "hints", which will be visualized on the client but otherwise do nothing. Presumably some code is added to run on completion that does do something.
			Example hint format on next lines
			{
				"data": "pipliz.diggerspecial",
				"type": "NPCType"
			}
		threatIncrease -> how much the monster threat level increases upon completing this science
		for AddScienceUnlocks entries, it only supports unlocksRecipes and unlocksRecipeGroups
